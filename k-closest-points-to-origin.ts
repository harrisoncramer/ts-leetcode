/*
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Naive Solution: Write a function to satisfy the getDistanceToZero (Euclidian distance) which is Math.sqrt(x^2 + y^2). Then, call a sort on the original input array which sorts them by their distance. Then get a slice of that result.

Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Faster Solution: Use a heap to keep track of the shortest distance. Since adding can happen in Log(k) time, where k is hte number of points we want to keep, this improves the time complexity from O(NlogN) to O(Nlog(k)) time. The space complexity is slightly worse, going from O(1) to O(k) where k is the size of the heap.

Time Complexity: O(N *Log(k)) because you have to check each point in the set, and each insert takes Log(k) time to put into our heap of k size
Space Complexity: O(K) (where k is the max number of elements you need to keep track of)
